This Task Management System demonstrates a comprehensive clean architecture for a Dart application with proper separation of concerns:

### Architecture Overview

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business entities (Task) and repository interfaces that define the contract for data access.

2. **Data Layer**: Implements repositories for persistence, with both file-based and in-memory options.

3. **Application Layer**: Contains services and use cases that implement business logic and orchestrate the application.

4. **Presentation Layer**: Provides a controller and CLI interface to interact with the system.

5. **Dependency Injection**: Uses a simple service locator pattern to manage dependencies.

### Key Data Structures & Algorithms

1. **Priority Queue**: Custom implementation for task scheduling based on priority and due dates.
2. **Binary Search**: For efficient searching in sorted task lists.
3. **Quick Sort**: Efficient sorting algorithm for task lists.
4. **Maps/Dictionaries**: For task storage and lookup by ID.
5. **Lists/Arrays**: For ordered collections of tasks.

### Advanced Features

1. **Task Filtering**: Composable filter chains with logical operators.
2. **Task Statistics**: Analytics capabilities for task completion and metrics.
3. **Import/Export**: Utilities for data migration between formats.
4. **Testing Framework**: Simple but effective unit and integration tests.

### Learning Opportunities

This project covers essential programming concepts:
- Object-oriented programming with inheritance and polymorphism
- Functional programming concepts with higher-order functions
- Error handling patterns
- File I/O operations
- Command-line interface implementation
- Clean code principles and SOLID design

The system can be expanded with additional features like:
- A graphical user interface
- Network synchronization
- Notifications and reminders
- User authentication and multi-user support
- More advanced analytics and reporting

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the architecture or add any other features to this project?
