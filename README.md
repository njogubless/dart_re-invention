# Dart Re-invention Learning Journey

This repository documents my 14-day intensive journey learning Dart, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Computer Science fundamentals.

## Learning Focus

- Dart language fundamentals
- Object-oriented programming concepts in Dart
- Data structures and algorithms implementation
- Computer Science core concepts (OS, networks, system design)

## Repository Structure

- `fundamentals/` - Dart language basics
- `oop/` - Object-oriented programming examples
- `dsa/` - Data structures and algorithms
- `computer-science/` - CS concepts and implementations
- `projects/` - Integration projects combining multiple concepts
- `resources/` - Learning materials and references

## Learning Schedule
This repository follows a structured 14-day learning plan:

1. **Days 1-4**: Dart fundamentals
2. **Day 5**: Review and consolidation
3. **Days 6-9**: Object-oriented programming and a mini-project
4. **Days 10-12**: Data structures and algorithms
5. **Day 13**: Computer science concepts
6. **Day 14**: Final project integrating all concepts

## Progress Tracking
My learning progress is documented in the [progress.md](progress.md) file, which includes:
- Daily learning topics and achievements
- Resources used
- Practice projects completed
- Personal notes and insights

## Getting Started
To explore this repository:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/njogubless/dart_re-invention.git`
2. Navigate through the directories to see examples and implementations
3. Review the [progress.md](progress.md) file to follow my learning journey

## Resources
